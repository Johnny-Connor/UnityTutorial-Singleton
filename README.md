# About it

_"Anything that's a manager class can and should be, for the most part, a singleton."_

_- Jonathan Weinberger, from GameDevHQ._

In this project, I will learn how to properly create a singleton. The code will have many explanatory comments to facilitate its comprehension in case I forget something about it in the future.
 
If you have any interest in learning about this topic, feel free to take a look at my notes too!

# Roadmap

- [x] Create a singleton.
- [x] Create a game that uses this mechanism.
- [x] Explain the crucial parts of the code through comments.
