# About it
_"Anything that's a manager class can and should be, for the most part, a singleton."_

_- Jonathan Weinberger, from GameDevHQ._

 In this project, I will watch GameDevHQ's tutorial video (https://youtu.be/EI1KJv8owCg) to learn how to properly create a singleton. The code will have many explanatory comments to facilitate its comprehension in case I forget something about it in the future.
 
If you have any interest in learning about this topic or just want a written summary of GameDevHQ's video, feel free to take a look at my notes too!

# Roadmap
- [ ] Create a singleton.
- [ ] Create a game that uses this mechanism.
- [ ] Explain the crucial parts of the code through comments.
