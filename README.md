# About it
 In this project, I will watch Reso Coder's tutorial video (https://youtu.be/CPKAgyp8cno) to learn how to properly create a singleton. The code will have many explanatory comments to facilitate its comprehension in case I forget something about it in the future.
 
If you have any interest in learning about this topic or just want a written summary of Reso Coder's video, feel free to take a look at my notes too!

# Roadmap
- [ ] Create a scene that gives the player the control to switch between scenes.
- [ ] Create a singleton.
- [ ] Explain the crucial parts of the code through comments.
